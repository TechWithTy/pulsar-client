❓ So what’s Pulsar’s internal caching actually good for — and is it worth using if Valkey handles app-level caching?
Let’s zoom in:

🧊 **[Pulsar Cache]** Pulsar’s Built-In Cache (Tiered Storage & BookKeeper)
**[Pulsar Cache]** Pulsar uses Apache BookKeeper and tiered storage to cache messages within the Pulsar messaging system itself, enabling efficient event delivery and replay:

🔄 1. Message Retention & Replay
Pulsar can retain historical messages (thanks to disk + cache layers), which means:

Consumers can replay events from a certain point (subscription.position = earliest)

You can rehydrate state or debug issues by "re-consuming"

Supports long-term message durability

Valkey does not do this. It’s fast, in-memory, and ephemeral unless configured with AOF/RDB — but even then, not in a structured log format.

🚀 2. High-Throughput Event Streaming
Pulsar is a solid choice when you need:

Event sourcing

Audit logs

Change Data Capture (CDC)

Durable pub/sub (e.g., ingest pipeline → transform service → database writer)

BookKeeper caching keeps hot segments in memory for fast delivery, while offloading older data to object storage (e.g., S3).

📈 3. Scaling Asynchronous Workflows
Even if Celery isn’t using Pulsar, you could use Pulsar for:

Logging/telemetry events

Chat/message buses

System metrics pipelines

Real-time dashboards

Notifying workers/services across languages

This is where its internal cache reduces disk I/O and keeps performance high under load.

## Cache Metrics Recommendation

Pulsar’s tiered cache is entirely broker-managed; HTTP client calls do not surface cache miss or delete events. As a result:

- We currently track `PULSAR_CACHE_HITS` and `PULSAR_CACHE_SETS` in the client for instrumentation, but `PULSAR_CACHE_MISSES` and `PULSAR_CACHE_DELETES` no longer fire and should be removed from both code and dashboards.
- For accurate cache hit/miss ratios, enable broker-side metrics via the Pulsar [JMX Exporter](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/metrics/), which exposes built-in cache metrics.

**Recommendation:**
1. Remove stale local miss/delete counters (`PULSAR_CACHE_MISSES`, `PULSAR_CACHE_DELETES`) from client code and Grafana panels.
2. Rely on broker-side cache metrics for observability.
3. If client-local metrics are required, consider implementing a local `PersistenceStore` from `pulsar.cache.persistence` to explicitly call `.get()/.set()/.delete()`, though this adds complexity.

This approach ensures production-ready cache monitoring while avoiding unsupported client-side hooks.

💡 Summary: What's the point of Pulsar's cache if you're already using Valkey?
Pulsar’s caching is not a general-purpose app cache like Valkey. It’s optimized for:

Efficient event delivery

Persistent message history

Backpressure tolerance

If you're not doing streaming/event-driven architecture yet, the internal cache won’t add value right now. But it will when:

You build microservices with Pulsar as the async backbone

You want guaranteed, replayable delivery

You want to decouple producers/consumers and scale
